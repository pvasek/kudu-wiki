### Prerequisites to run Kudu
We have recently created a few custom scripts to automate the setup of Kudu development dependencies
see the readme for [KuduDevSetup.cmd](https://github.com/projectkudu/kudu/tree/master/Setup) for details. The new approach has been minimally tested so the older manual instruction below are still worth reading to understand what the new script does. The script requires that [WebPI 4.5](http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx) be installed. Once you have WebPI install simply execute the script from the directory.

### Manual Setup Instructions
* Visual Studio 2013. Note that you need to run it as admin. Install/Update to the latest version of NuGet Package Manager (Tools -> Extensions and Updates).
* IIS >= 7, configured to run ASP.NET 4.0. This can be installed using [WebPI](http://www.microsoft.com/web/downloads/platform.aspx).
* Install Git (http://git-scm.com/downloads) to the default location (we expect it in ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Git\bin```).
* Install [Node](http://nodejs.org/). Node is used as part of the build process for sites.

Note: If you manually install IIS, here is what needs to be enabled:

### Additional prerequisites to run the functional tests

* Install the XUnit.net runner for VS 2013, which you install from Tools / Extensions & Updates
* Install [ASP.NET WebPages 1.0](http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=15979)
* Install [MVC 3](http://www.asp.net/mvc/mvc3).
* Open your %WINDIR%\System32\inetsrv\config\applicationHost.config and look for `<applicationPoolDefaults>`. Under `<processModel>`, make sure you don't have `setProfileEnvironment="false"`. If you do, set it to true (or remove the attribute if you are running the latest Windows 8.1).
* unzip [this file](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/2209341/Kudu_Progx86_Msbuild_Microsoft_VisualStudio.zip) and copy the contents into your `\Program Files (x86)\MSBuild\Microsoft\VisualStudio`. This brings in various files from older VS versions that you may not have installed.
* Install the [URL rewrite module for IIS](http://www.iis.net/download/URLRewrite).
* Install [IISNode](https://github.com/Azure/iisnode/releases/download/v0.2.11/iisnode-full-v0.2.11-x64.msi)
* Pretend to have the 32 bit version of Node to fool the version detection logic:
 * Copy your `\Program Files\nodejs` folder to \Program Files (x86)\nodejs.
 * Under `\Program Files (x86)\nodejs`, you need to have a folder named `0.8.2`, and containing [node.exe version 0.8.2](http://nodejs.org/dist/v0.8.2/node.exe). And then same deal for Node 0.10.5 (you can put the 0.8.2 exe in the 0.10.5 folder; it's the folder that matters). Yes, this is kind of painful, and we need to make it easier!
* Install [Mercurial](http://mercurial.selenic.com/downloads) to the default location (we expect it in ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Mercurial```)


### Deploying your first application
1. First clone the repository.

        git clone git://github.com/projectkudu/kudu.git

3. Open Kudu.sln as **Administrator** and build it.

4. Set **Kudu.Web** as the startup project and run!

After running Kudu.Web, you should be able to use the dashboard to manage your application. Below is a walk through on how to create and deploy your first application using git.

### Step 1
